# AI LLM Exploration - Repo to explore usage and advantages of different vendors in the LLM world.

## Exploring GPT4All - by Nomic
GPT4All is an open-source ecosystem used for integrating LLMs into applications without paying for a platform or hardware subscription. It was created by Nomic AI, an information cartography company that aims to improve access to AI resources.

GPT4All is designed to run on modern to relatively modern PCs without needing an internet connection or even a GPU! This is possible since most of the models provided by GPT4All have been quantized to be as small as a few gigabytes, requiring only 4â€“16GB RAM to run

### Requirements
Python 3.10+

### Usage
This project uses GPT4ALL as an LLM integrated into Langchain workflows

Activate your python environment and run it.
```bash
poetry shell
python gpt_4_all/main.py

```

### GPT4All website
https://gpt4all.io/index.html

### Conclusions
This project is still under development, not concrete stability, and a more than 200 open issues in its github repo without any solution yet.
